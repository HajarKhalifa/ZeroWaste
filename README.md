# Overview
## For a better future, 
Zero Waste is an innovative and comprehensive solution designed to empower individuals and organizations to reduce waste and create a sustainable future.
It includes an easy-to-use application interface that enables efficient classification of waste, with material classification. Users earn Recycling Credits (R.C) for their recycling efforts, which can be redeemed for rewards and incentives. The system provides convenient waste collection options, including door-to-door pickups and branch drop-off facilities. In addition, the robust management system facilitates team collaboration and tracks profits. Zero Waste goes beyond recycling by promoting a circular economy through an online store, where consumers can purchase products designed for easy recycling and economical return. With Zero Waste, individuals and organizations can actively contribute to reducing waste and building a cleaner, more sustainable world.
